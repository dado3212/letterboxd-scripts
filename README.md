There's a [Letterboxd API](https://api-docs.letterboxd.com/) but it's a mostly private API [here](https://letterboxd.com/api-beta/). In the past I've used a combination of TMDb's API, scraping Letterboxd, or using their `.zip` export (for [Letterboxd Gaps](https://alexbeals.com/projects/letterboxd/) and [letterboxd-anim](https://github.com/dado3212/letterboxd-anim) among others. But if you happen to get access to the API ([\*cough\*](#notyet)) then these are some of the scripts that I've used in the past.

## Installation

Get an API key, either through the formal process or...[other ways](#notyet).

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
